# Welcome to Spotify Clone (Strive) 👋

> This is a team project done at Strive School at the end of 1st month. It is made using HTML/CSS together with Bootstrap 4.6 to achieve
responsive design. This is not meant to be a fully fleshed out Spotify clone but a mere test and challenge of our skills and knowledge we achieved.

> The project consists of 4 main pages: Home page,artist page, album page, and signup/login page. The player is functional only in album page.
